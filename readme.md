- This repository is the home for the new and maintained version of DFlat. It replaces DFlat-Tensorflow.
- Note that this package is no longer a direct port of pytorch-tensorflow but is a complete rewrite (re-)released in February 2024. 
- The structure of the software is completely revamped and the algorithms used--in particular for field propagation--is not the same as before. The original pytorch version (now deprecated) is archived as a seperate branch only for archival purposes.
