## This repository is the home for the new and maintained version of DFlat. It replaces DFlat-Tensorflow.
Note that this package is no longer a direct port of pytorch-tensorflow but is a complete rewrite. The structure of the framework is completely revamped in most places and the algorithms used--in particular for field propagation--is not the same as before. The old pytorch version is now archived as a seperate branch (kept only for historical reasons).
