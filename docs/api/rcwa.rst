RCWA 
====

Module Overview
---------------
This module provides an auto-differentiable RCWA field solver. We acknowledge base code originally written in tensorflow by Shane Colburn (RCWA-TF). The RCWA class enables easy computation of the complex field profile 
transmitted/reflected after illuminating layered material structures.
